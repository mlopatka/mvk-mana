- Setup Git repo
- Installed PyCharm and set up a Python 3.7 interpreter

- Downloaded anaconda and ran it in the shell
bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-5.3.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

In PyCharm, created a Conda environment
added nltk to the environment

Began hacking on some NLP stuff-ultimately followed the examples from https://www.bogotobogo.com/python/NLTK/tf_idf_with_scikit-learn_NLTK.php
to start scoring the corpus for some relevant terms.

Created a data directory with all of the CoE mana pages as well as a new hire page for baselining

TO PORT THE ENVIRONMENT- created the spec_list following the Anaconda docs fir building identical environments, then used conda install on the new box with the spec list (see https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
